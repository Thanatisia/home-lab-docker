      ### Stacks Directory
      # ⚠️ READ IT CAREFULLY. If you did it wrong, your data could end up writing into a WRONG PATH.
      # ⚠️ 1. FULL path only. No relative path (MUST)
      # ⚠️ 2. Left Stacks Path === Right Stacks Path (MUST)
      # - "/path/to/docker/container/root/directory:/opt/stacks"
      - "/opt/stacks:/opt/stacks"
